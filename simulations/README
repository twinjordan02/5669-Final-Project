# What to do with these files
Add .h files to unitree_ros/unitree_controller/include
Add .cpp files to unitree_ros/unitree_controller/src
Run the .m file to generate the gait trajectories in C++-copyable format that can be pasted into the body.cpp file
Update CMakeLists for these src files and run catkin_make, similar to the instructions for the real robot


# to run a simulation
In terminal one: 
'source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash'
'source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash'
start ros up
'roscore'

in terminal two:
'source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash'
'source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash'
to run Rviz (optional)
'cd ~/catkin_ws'
'roslaunch go1_description go1_rviz.launch'
to run Gazebo
'roslaunch unitree_gazebo normal.launch rname:=go1 wname:=earth' can also do stairs or space instead of earth

in terminal three:
'source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash'
'source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash'
now to start the controller sequence with leg stand, etc.
'cd ~/catkin_ws'
`rosrun unitree_controller unitree_servo` # to stand up the robot
`rosrun unitree_controller unitree_move_kinetic` # robot moves in a circle
`rosrun unitree_controller walk_gait` # if you update CMakeLists.txt to run the walk file for example

# Misc.
You might need to rebuild the packages if it can't find a package or if you get RLException
`cd ~/catkin_ws`
`rm -rf build devel`
`catkin_make`
`source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash`
`source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash`
