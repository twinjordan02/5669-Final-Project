## Include files
These are the header files which compile with the source code to execute gaits. They are as follows:
- gait.h -> header file that contains important global structures, and the code needed to generate gaits in the executables.
- spline.h -> header file that is used to generate a cubic spline path that is used to compute the foot trajectory for each gait. This is from [this repo](https://github.com/snsinfu/cxx-spline).
